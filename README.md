GitDeck - repos to decks
========================

GitDeck creates beautiful slide decks from your GitHub repository in minutes. Your entire presentation is organized using JSON.

You can see the [full documentation](http://gitdeck.me/docs) on our website. If you're new to GitDeck, check out the [Getting Started](http://gitdeck.me/docs#getting-started) article.

If you've already got a deck to generate, [do it now!](http://gitdeck.me)

How it Works
------------

You create a JSON file according to the GitDeck syntax and upload it to a public Github repository. Then, you visit [our website](http://gitdeck.me) and enter the repository name. We use the file to generate a beautiful HTML5 responsive deck that you can use for presentations.

You can jazz your decks up by using predefined templates or by creating your own. For more information on templates, see the [template section](http://gitdeck.me/docs#templates) in our docs.

This Repository
---------------

GitDeck is a service which operates solely out of http://gitdeck.me. This repository holds the code for the parser which ties the JSON file, the template file(s) and everything else together. We think it's important for our users to see how it's done and possibly improve the process by contributing in the form of pull requests or issues.

We also have a database of templates in the [gitdeck-templates repository](https://github.com/gitdeck/gitdeck-templates).
